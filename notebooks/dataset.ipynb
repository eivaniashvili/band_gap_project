    "## 1. Overview  \n",
    "The `matbench_mp_gap` dataset is a supervised regression dataset for predicting the **DFT-PBE computed electronic band gap** (in eV) of inorganic materials from their crystal structures.  \n",
    "Each row corresponds to one material structure (bulk inorganic crystal) represented via a `pymatgen.Structure` object.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Task type:** Regression  \n",
    "**Input:** `structure` (crystal structure)  \n",
    "**Target:** `band_gap_eV` (original column name `gap pbe`)  \n",
    "**Typical size:** ~106,000 entries.  \n",

    "\n",
    "- Number of rows: ~106,000  \n",
    "- Mean band gap: ≈ 1.21 eV  \n",
    "- Standard deviation: ≈ 1.59 eV  \n",
    "- Median band gap: ≈ 0.25 eV  \n",
    "- Percentage of “metals” (gap ≈ 0): ≈ 46%  \n",

    "## 5. Usage notes & limitations  \n",
    "- The band gaps are **DFT-PBE** values, which typically **underestimate experimental band gaps** by ~0.5–1 eV or more depending on material chemistry. Therefore, ML models trained on this dataset are approximating DFT-level gaps—not necessarily experimental values.  \n",
    "- Because this is a **structure‐based task**, it is suitable for models that take crystal structures → features (or graph representations).  \n",
    "- The dataset contains a **large fraction of “metals”** (gap ≈ 0) and also insulators/semiconductors (nonzero gaps). Care must be taken in splitting to avoid leakage between similar chemical systems.  \n",
    "- Missing data may appear in derived descriptors (e.g., when featurizers cannot compute some elemental property). In our pipeline we drop high‐missing‐rate features, then impute missing values using median + indicator columns, fitted only on the **training set** to avoid leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Suggested train/val/test split strategy (used in this project)  \n",
    "- Split by **chemical system group** (unique unordered element-sets) to avoid overlapping chemistries between train, val, and test.  \n",
    "- Stratify based on target (band gap) deciles to preserve distribution across splits.  \n",
    "- Recommended final split proportions: ~60–70% train, ~15–20% validation, ~15–20% test.\n",
